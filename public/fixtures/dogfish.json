This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"type":"beer"},{"id":"jg1aNw","name":"Beer Thousand","description":"The flavor is sweet, malty and boozy up front with a warm alcohol bite and a clean, slightly bitter finish","abv":"10","ibu":"60","styleId":99,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/jg1aNw/upload_uWpere-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/jg1aNw/upload_uWpere-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/jg1aNw/upload_uWpere-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-19 13:52:29","updateDate":"2015-02-02 14:28:45","style":{"id":99,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Ice Lager","description":"This style is slightly higher in alcohol than most other light-colored, American-style lagers.

The hints of molasses and pit-fruit are balanced by vibrant strawberry notes and a unique complexity that comes with the addition of a malty buckwheat honey.\r\n\r\nWe believe health-conscious beer drinkers and the millions of Americans who suffer from Celiac disease can cut back on gluten while relishing the distinction and drinkability of this very special brew.\r\n\r\nTweasonale is a seasonal for between the seasons. It first hit shelves in late January 2012 and will be released four times a year through our national network of distributors.","abv":"6","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":127,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Qx1hbt/upload_gXNejr-icon.png","medium":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Qx1hbt/upload_gXNejr-medium.png","large":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Qx1hbt/upload_gXNejr-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Fatty fish, dried fruit, salted nuts","createDate":"2012-04-23 23:50:56","updateDate":"2014-08-08 02:06:40","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":127,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Gluten-Free Beer","description":"A beer (lager, ale or other) that is made from fermentable sugars, grains and converted carbohydrates.
